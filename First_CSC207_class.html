  <!-- Introduction to Web  -->
  <h2>
    <center>What is the Web?
  </h2>
  </center>
  <p>The Web is basically a system of interenet servers that supports specially formarted documents.
    The documents are formmated in a markup language called HTML(HyperText Markup Language) thats supports links to
    other documents as well as graphics, audios and video files.</p>

  <!-- Some terminologies in web -->
  <p><b>Internet</b>: This is a masssive network of networks. It connects millions of computers together globally
    forming a network in which any computer can communicate with another computer as long as they are both connected to
    the internet.</p>
  <p><b>Browser</b>: This is a computer software that allows a client to interact and view the contents of a webpage.
    Examples are Opera, Firefox, Chrome etc.</p>
  <p><b>Clients</b>: These are devices which from a browser view or interact with a website.</p>
  <p><b>Servers</b>: This is a machine which contains all the information of a website.</p>

  <!--How a webpage works-->
  <h2>
    <center>How does a Webpage work?</center>
  </h2>
  <p>A client uses a browser to view a webpage; the client must be connected to the internet and have a web browser. The
    client then type in the URL(Universal Resource Locator) in the address bar of the browser.
    The URL is now sent to the DNS(Domain Name System) server which searches for the IP(Internet Protocol) of the
    website's server. After locating the server the server sends back its information back to the client through the
    browser. </p>

  <!-- What HTML is all about -->
  <h1>
    <center>HTML</center>
  </h1>
  <p>HTML means HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used to program websites.

    <!-- What are tags? -->
    <p><b><u>Tags</u></b> :These are set of characters which contain a formmated command for a webpage. A tag is used to
      define the structure on a HTML page.
      Tags are used in writing commands in HTML and are very neccesary. They are started with a less-than sign <b>(
        <)</b> and closed with greater-than sign <b>(>)</b>.</p>

    <!-- Types of tags -->
    <p>There two types of tags namely:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Container tags</li>
      <li>Self Closing Tags</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Container Tags</b>: This type of tags start with a open tag and ends with a closing tag.
        <br><br><u>Syntax</u> <br>For example, The bold tag: It starts with <q cite="">
          < b> <i>text...</i> and ends with < /b> </q> </li> <br>
      <li><b>Self closing Tags</b>: As the name implies it means it does not have a closing tag.<br><br><u>Syntax</u>
        <br> It is written at the front of a line. <q cite="">
          < <i>tag</i> ><i> text...</i>
        </q> It does not end with a closing tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Comment tag</b>: A comment tag is basically used for documentation. It is written in the code to make a
      particular line more explainary for a person reading the code.
      <br><br><u>Syntax</u> <br>
      < ! --<i>text...</i>-- >
    </p>

    <!-- Attributes -->
    <p><b><u>Attributes</u></b>: These are used to change the default appearance of a tag. To add an attribute to a tag;
      it must be included in the open tag.<br><br><u>Syntax</u><br>For example< <i>tag</i> name = <q cite=""
          class="color">value</q>> </p>
